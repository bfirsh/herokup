herokup
=======

Upload stuff to Heroku that isn't in Git.

Install
-------

Put ``herokup`` somewhere on your path.

Usage
-----

In a directory you want to upload:

    $ herokup myapp
    Uploading to app "myapp"

    ...

    http://myapp.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku

If you've already got a Heroku app in the current directory or you've already run ``herokup`` once, the first argument is redundant.
